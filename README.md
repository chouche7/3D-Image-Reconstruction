# 3D Reconstruction from 2D Images  #

This folder contains files regarding 3-dimensional scene reconstruction using 2-dimensional images. Because the 3D images must be rotated manually, it is suggested that you run the files yourself to experience it. Otherwise, you can watch the demo videos for more information. 

The image files used in the notebook are included in the "ex" folders. If you want to run the python files separately, they are included; otherwise, just use the jupyter notebook.
